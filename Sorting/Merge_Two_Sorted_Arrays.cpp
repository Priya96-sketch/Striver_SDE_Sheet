//1st Approach ->By using a third array, which will cost Extra Space
// Time Complexity for the first approach is -> O(log n)+ O(N) + O(N) . Also here the approach is being implemented for unsorted array. Hence to sort the array time Complexity is 
// O(log n).

//2nd Approach -> Insertion Sort kinda algorithm, where no extra space will be occupied.
//Time Complexity for the 2nd Approach -> O(n1*m1). n1 -> for linear traversal through the first array. m1 -> for rearranging the elements in the array.
// This is GAP METHOD.
// In this/ method -> First add the number of elements of the two arrays and then divided by do. Repeat the process unill it becomes 1.
//For example if 1st = 5 in size & 2nd = 3 in size.
// Gap ->8/2 = 4
// Gap -> 4/2=2
// Gap -> 2/2 =1
